    <p>Right after Highschool I joined the military and it has has been an important part of my life because it taught me many things. I've learned disipline, and patience among other values that are key parts of my life. I have the ability to install, operate, and maintain: Multi-Channel Transmission Systems, Computer and
        Communication Networks, and Radio and Telecommunications Transmission Basics. While in this role I have supported several bases of over 350 users managing all individual
        requests be it password changes, software problems, to scheduling software installations and
        upgrades. Also, while in this field I have acted as a temporary Team Chief while providing
        support during Operation Spartan Shield & Operation Enduring Freedom. In this position I was
        tasked with setting up satellite equipment and setting up a working network for our remote
        site. We set up and maintained network and VoIP services for the site. We also configured
        Vlans and maintained blade servers while on site.</p>
    <p>During my time at AT&T I was able to gain tons of knowledge and meet many people. I Handled the installation and repair of AT&T's Copper and Fiber Optics at the customers
        premises or businesses. Used testing tools and installation techniques for Copper, Fiber
        Optics and DTV networks to ensure all quality metrics could be met to provide quality
        internet, phone and video services to customers and businesses. Installed Fiber Optics,
        Coax, and Ethernet Cable infrastructure. Assisted customers with setup of home
        networks upon completion of layer 1 installation. Assisted customers by
        troubleshooting and assisting with hardware and software set up both in person and
        remotely.</p>
